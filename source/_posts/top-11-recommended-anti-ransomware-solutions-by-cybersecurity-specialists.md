## Some Backup Tools

Backing up is not only necessary for protecting your files in case of a ransomware attack, but there are many other factors like system crash, hard-drive crash, and others when it becomes essential for a backup of your files.

Or you can also back them in an external hard disk. These cloud services don’t provide an auto-backup option, but you can manually do that regularly. But things get different for an enterprise-level of backing up.

So for an extensive backup, you can go for the following options:
