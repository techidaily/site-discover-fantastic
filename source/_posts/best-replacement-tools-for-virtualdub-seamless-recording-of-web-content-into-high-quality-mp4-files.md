## Best Replacement Tools for VirtualDub: Seamless Recording of Web Content Into High-Quality MP4 Files

### Overview

VirtualDub is a free and open-source video capture and video editing program initially developed for Microsoft Windows and normally save the captured video in AVI format. But recently some users report that some issues happened when users use VirtualDub to capture their needed video. Let's see some examples below.

* Hey, guys. I am trying to capture one video from VHS tape and I am following the instructions strictly and doing everything right, but I can not get the captured video file played after the capturing process end and it seems that I captured nothing.
* I captured one video file with VirtualDub, but there are lots of thin lines on the video image which caused me bad mood. How to solve this?
* Why there is no sound in my VirtualDub captured video file? I can get the image played normally, but not the sound. What is the problem?

Well, in users daily life, the captured videos can be used more flexibly, like offline playback on any device, editing the video to get users wanted video part, re-uploading to users personal blog, etc, so it really gets users upset when their video capture program - VirtualDub can not work normally. Solution?

Of course, you can contact VirtualDub Customers service to get relative help, but it will cost time and in most cases the Customers service will not know what really caused the capture work failure without knowing more information about your device, your operation steps. In view of these, most of users will choose a VirtualDub alternative to get a successful video capturing.
