Whenever a security solution displays the IDP.ALEXA.51 warning, it indicates that an unusual behavioral pattern has been detected by the antimalware, that is, the cybercriminals attempted to steal your personal information. The IDP stands for **Identity Detection Protection**. 

However, several times an antimalware show a **false-positive** result because it is outdated or broken. A false-positive result means that antimalware would catch the program or files that are not malware. As a result, many safe applications such as Plants vs. Zombies or SeaMonkey, and others are marked as malicious. So people tend to ignore the IDP.ALEXA.51 threat. 

It is where cybercriminals take advantage. They release and bypass the malicious files by naming them similar to legit files. Most users usually ignore the warnings from the security solution, thinking them as a false-positive. 

The user should always check the files thoroughly before marking them safe.

In this guide, we would discuss more on IDP.ALEXA.51 virus and how to remove it from your system.
