## Get Your New DJ Software Update Now! Experience DEX 3.13.0.5 with Enhanced Features for PCDJ Systems

**Version 3.13.0.5 of DEX 3, our best DJ program for the versatile DJ, is ready for download!**

Considered an interim release, DEX 3.13.0.5 now includes the recently updated LYRX (our new karaoke software) skins along with improvements that include the ability to swiftly search singers names from the default search box. You’ll find a new “S” button in the search box that when toggled on, will search for and locate singers and their song history.

As of this time the “S” search function is only available within the included LYRX and LYRX 12 skins (accessible under options -> general -> “select user interface” drop down menu).

Improvements have also been made to the key stepping engine, providing better precision and consistency.

Our development team is working on a few significant upgrades to DEX 3 at this time. We will email DEX 3 customers when the next update is available.

Download DEX 3.13.0.5 below and install with your existing version closed to update now. As always, version 3.13.0.5 is a free update for DEX 3 customers.
