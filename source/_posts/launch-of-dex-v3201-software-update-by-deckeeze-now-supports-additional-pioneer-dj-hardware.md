## Launch of DEX v3.20.1 Software Update by Deckeeze | Now Supports Additional Pioneer DJ Hardware

[![](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pioneer-DJ-Controllers-DEX3.jpg?resize=845%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Pioneer-DJ-Controllers-DEX3.jpg?fit=1030%2C558&ssl=1 "Pioneer DJ Controllers Supported in DEX 3.20.1")

**Download DEX 3.20.1, the latest free update to our flagship DJ software and a ‘must-install’ if you use a Pioneer DJ controller.**

Just last week we announced the release of [DEX 3.20](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), which centered around improved beat-grid and beat-detection technology. This week, DEX 3.20.1 is available and the focus is support for newer Pioneer DJ controllers and improved support for previously supported units.

[About DEX 3 ![PCDJ DEX 3](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dex3-macbook-tidal.png?fit=300%2C169&ssl=1 "PCDJ DEX 3")](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)

Pioneer DJ has a reputation for producing high-quality, reliable, and innovative DJ controllers, including one of their recent releases and top-seller the REV-1\. DEX 3.20.1 now includes support for the [REV-1](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-rev1/black/overview/), the [DDJ-400](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/controller/ddj-400/black/overview/), and [DDJ-200](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/controller/ddj-200/black/overview/) Pioneer DJ controllers. [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) DJs can now enjoy plug-and-play support for these controllers, as well as improved support for twelve previously supported Pioneer DJ controllers (most notably, improved jog wheel support).

If you already use a Pioneer DJ controller or plan on purchasing one in the near future, installing DEX 3.20.1 is a must. Also, included are a few bug fixes and performance improvements, so non-Pioneer DJ controller users will still want to update.
