## How does Mr. Beast Giveaway Scam Work?

In the “Mr. Beast Giveaway” scam, people who are subscribed to the MrBeast YouTube channel and visit this page can win $1,000\. Users are told to click the “CLAIM REWARD” button on the page in order to get the fake prize.

This will send them to a page where they can download software from the sponsors of the hoax giveaway. This promoted software program is malicious in nature and may result in [ransomware attack](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or [identity theft](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

Sometimes, user might be asked to subscribe to a service or [pay a small token amount](https://medium.com/resonates/mr-beast-were-you-trying-to-scam-me-130753cbb6da) (say $39 to $99) in order to claim the cash prize.

Scammers could also get to your credit card or PayPal account, which you have to give them in order to get your cash prize. They can now send you phishing links in the same email to access your PayPal account or sell your account information to cybercriminals.
