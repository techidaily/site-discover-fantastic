**Our DJ controller mapping guru’s have updated the Pioneer WeGO2 map to provide improved plug-and-play support for both [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (pro edition) and [DEX 3 RE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (red edition).**

Released all the way back in 2013 (in ‘DJ controller years’ that’s a lifetime), the **DDJ-WeGO2** is an ultra-compact **DJ Controller** that’s nearly the exact width as a 13″ laptop keyboard.

**Pioneer DJ** designed the **WeGO2** to make it easy for bedroom DJs and hobbyists to learn the DJing essentials by providing users with a simple means of creating “cool and unique mixes with their own music collection”. It definitely screams ‘consumer’ due to Pioneer DJs unique application of LED’s and “pulse control”.

The **DDJ-WeGO2** offers a smattering of advanced but easy to use, functions and features that make the art of DJing fun and simple including: FX, multi-color LED illumination, iPhone/iPad/iPod touch compatibility and support for **[DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)** such as [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and [DEX 3 RE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (with the download map file below).

Our team more recently wrapped up support for the newer and currently sold [Pioneer WeGO3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and felt a few additional tweaks to the **WeGO2** script were in order. Our DJ software and the way it communicates with [DJ controllers](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) has been greatly improved over the last 3 years and the updated script will offer tighter, more responsive control when using the **WeGO2** to operate DEX 3 and DEX 3 RE.

For bedroom DJs or hobbyists the **Pioneer WeGO2** is a solid option, it should hold up well for backpack trips to a friends house party and party-goers should enjoy the built in light show produced by the “Pulse” feature.

### MIXING MADE EASY

The **DDJ-WeGO2** utilizes visual prompts and audio cues, built-in effects and features, and includes accessories to make DJ performances effortless:

* **Jog FX** – Allows users to combine multiple effects and control them simultaneously using the Jog wheel.
* **Pulse** **Control** – Provides users with visual prompts with a variety of colored lights on the Jog platters:  
   * **Mix Pulse** – Lights around the jog wheel show the beat of tracks in play. The lights lose intensity as the beats go out of sync, giving novices a visual aid to beat matching.  
   * **Launch Pulse** – A red light travels from the Load button to the jog wheel when a track has loaded successfully so DJs know when a track is ready to play.  
   * **FX Pulse** – The effect being applied to the currently playing song will not only be heard, but will also be represented visually via the light movements on the Jog wheel.
* **USB Powered** – The DDJ-WeGO2 utilizes power from USB connections found on most computers, eliminating the need for an external power supply.
* **Other features**  
   * Built-in audio ports for high quality sound input and output.  
   * Built-in sound card for expanded music storage and portability.  
   * Compact size – 14.9″ x 8.2″ x 2.5″ (without stand).  
   * Weighs 3.53 lbs (without stand) for easy transportation.
