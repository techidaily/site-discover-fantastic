### Method 1\. Recover files from ransomware with data recovery software

Usually, ransomware removes the original data after the intrusion. The encrypted files it creates are not the original files, but copies. Therefore, with the help of professional data recovery software, you can easily retrieve your original files deleted by ransomware.

[MyRecover](https://www.myrecover.com/windows-recovery/?%5Fdi%5Fc=ZGV2X2lkXzQyNTJjN2YxLWU3NDAtNDFhOS05MDA5LWYyMWQyODg4Mjg4Mg==) is fully-featured ransomware data recovery software that allows you to restore lost data from infected hard drives under **trojan**, **malware**, **worms**, and various virus attacks, and from **system crashes**.

With this tool, you can [recover deleted files](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/), photos, audio, music, emails, and hundreds of other types of files without any effort. It supports you to recover lost data from hard drives, USB flash drives, memory cards, SD cards, emptied Recycle Bin, etc.

Simply download and install this software on your computer, and then follow the steps below to learn how to recover data from ransomware:

### Method 2\. Recover ransomware infected files via Backup and Restore

If you have a backup available, restoring files is as simple as ABC. You can easily recover encrypted files by finding the corresponding backup file and restoring the data you need. But this option is possible only when you regularly back up your data.

The how to recover ransomware encrypted files guide is instructed as follows. You can simply initiate a data restoration from Windows backup created through the [Backup and Restore](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/backup-and-restore-in-windows-352091d2-bb9d-3ea3-ed18-52ef2b88cbef) software when all your files have been encrypted by ransomware.

Step 1\. Open **Control Panel** and click on **System and Security**. Then, hit **Backup and Restore (Windows 7)**.

[![Windows Backup And Restore](https://www.ubackup.com/data-recovery-disk/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/data-recovery-disk/windows/windows-backup-and-restore.png)

Step 2\. Tap on the **Restore my files** position in the Restore tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step 3\. Click **Browse for files** to locate your lost data and choose to save your recovered files in your original location or another destination as needed.

[![Browse For Files To Restore](https://www.ubackup.com/data-recovery-disk/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/data-recovery-disk/windows/browse-for-files-to-restore.png)

### Method 3\. Get back files from ransomware using File History

If you have used File History to save a copy of your precious data, you can follow the steps below to figure out how to recover encrypted files from ransomware. You can use this tool to [recover permanently deleted folders](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/) and files on your computer as well.

Step 1\. Go to **Control Panel** \> **System and Security**, and click on **File History**.

[![File History](https://www.ubackup.com/data-recovery-disk/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/data-recovery-disk/windows/file-history.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step 2\. Press the **Restore personal files** button on the left panel. Please make sure your File History is turned on.

[![Restore Personal Files](https://www.ubackup.com/data-recovery-disk/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/data-recovery-disk/windows/restore-personal-files.png)

Step 3\. Find the files you want to recover and click the arrow pointing left or right to choose the version you need. And then, click the **Recover** button.

### Method 4\. Recover from ransomware through system restore

If you have created a restore point for your system, the system restore can bring your PC back to a previous point in time. This means that you can get back files on your computer that have been encrypted by ransomware through a system restore point.

Next, let’s have a look at how to recover files infected by ransomware from a system restore.

Step 1\. Press **Win + S** to open the Windows search box, type **Create a restore point**, and click **Open** from the list of results.

[![Create A Restore Point Open](https://www.ubackup.com/data-recovery-disk/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/data-recovery-disk/windows/create-a-restore-point-open.png)

Step 2\. Click on **System Restore** \> **Next**.

[![System Drive On System Restore Next](https://www.ubackup.com/data-recovery-disk/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/data-recovery-disk/windows/system-drive-on-system-restore-next.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step 3\. Choose a restore point from the list and tap on **Scan for affected programs** to check the items that will be deleted after the restore. Then, click **Close**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step 4\. Press **Next**. Confirm the selected restore point and click **Finish**. Then, hit **Yes** to begin the [recovery of deleted files](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/).

If there is no restore point, it might be because the system protection isn't turned on. You can check **Protection Settings** on the System Protection tab. If the Protection Settings for your system drive shows as **Off**, you can click on **Configure** \> **Turn on System protection**, and then OK to turn it on.

[![Turn On System Protection Ok](https://www.ubackup.com/data-recovery-disk/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.ubackup.com/screenshot/en/data-recovery-disk/windows/turn-on-system-protection-ok.png)

Notes:✎...

Some ransomware decryption tools can help to decrypt files encrypted by ransomware. However, such tools do not fully guarantee that ransomware-encrypted files can be recovered. Thus, recovering files infected by ransomware using a ransomware recovery service like MyRecover or with the help of a backup file are the easiest and most workable ways.

**Some tips on preventing ransomware**

To prevent ransomware from attacking your computer and files again, we list several tips for you:

* Make sure the antivirus software is enabled on the computer.
* Don't click on emails and connections sent by strangers.
* Report ransomware attacks to let authorities identify the attacker.
* Regularly back up important data in case of emergencies.

## Conclusion

Ransomware can't be prevented. Though there are multiple ways for you to accomplish how to recover files from ransomware, prevention is easier than rescue. We highly recommend you backup your important data periodically.
