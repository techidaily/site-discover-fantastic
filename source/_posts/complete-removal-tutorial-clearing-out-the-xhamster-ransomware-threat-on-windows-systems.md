2. **Remove Ransomware** – After completing the scan, program will get rid of all the instances of XHamster ransomware and stop its spread.
3. **Stay Protected** – It is impossible to unlock the encrypted files. All we can do is protect yourself from future ransomware attacks. It is possible to shield yourself by using a powerful antivirus program like [TotalAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). It offers all round protection from different types of malware at an affordable price.

XHAMSTER ransomware is a computer virus that encrypts all files on the system, making them unreadable. This malware is an Phobos ransomware variant. After encrypting all data using military-grade encryption, it appends a lengthy extension including the victim’s ID, the hackers’ ICQ username, and the.XHAMSTER file marker to each file. 

For example, a file named 1.jpg will be renamed 1.jpg.id\[C291B210-3542\]. \[ICQ@xhamster2020\]. XHAMSTER and the remaining data will be tagged in the same manner.

The ransomware also leaves ransom-demanding messages (info.hta and info.txt) on the computer, recommending that a specific amount be paid for the XHAMSTER file decryption tool.

## How Xhamster Virus Works / Infects?

. XHAMSTER File Virus usually enters your system invisibly, so you have no idea when and how all of your files were encrypted. Hackers utilise spam email techniques to deliver malicious attachments directly to the targeted machine’s inbox, where the virus is installed as soon as the user opens the email. 

When you download bundled freeware tools, shareware apps, pirated software, unauthorised patches, and so on from untrustworthy and shady sources, you are more likely to get the XHAMSTER file infection.

### Ransom Note Details

This variant of ransomware puts two types of ransom notes on the PC. The first is a text file named info.txt, which states that the victim’s data was encrypted due to a “security issue with the PC.” It further instructs the victim to download ICQ software and send messages to the attackers’ account, which bears the username @xhamster2020\. The note also instructs you to include the victim’s ID in the message’s headline.

ATTENTION!!!
Unfortunately for you, a major IT security weakness left you open to attack.
All your files have been encrypted with ciphers more advanced than those used for diplomatic communications.
You can spend days and months searching for a magical way to decrypt your files, but rest assured we are the only people who can help you recover your files, there is no free tool.
If you want to restore files, install ICQ software on your PC here hxxps://icq.com/windows/ or on your mobile phone search in Appstore / Google play market "ICQ"
Write to our ICQ @xhamster2020 hxxps://icq.im/xhamster2020
Write file ID in the title of your message
Before paying you can send us up to 5 files for free decryption. The total size of files must be less than 3Mb and files should not contain valuable information.
Attention!
Do not rename encrypted files.
Do not try to decrypt your data using third party software, it may cause permanent data loss.
Decryption of your files with the help of third parties may cause increased price (they add their fee to our) or you can become a victim of a scam.

As a standard protocol, the attackers want to receive payment in cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin, as this allows them to hide their identities. According to the note, the attackers set the payment based on how quickly the victim writes to them following the attack. They also offer a complimentary decryption service on five encrypted files to demonstrate that they can restore the data.
