## What is Bing.com?

Bing.com is a legitimate [search engine](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) from Microsoft and one of the most popular search engines globally. It is on the fifth number in the list of most searches. Also, it comes at second place in the search engine’s listing after Google.com.

Though it itself is not a threat, it is widely promoted by malicious extensions or apps that get an entry on your browser and change its settings.

These web extensions or applications that illegitimately get access to your browser’s settings and alter it are known as[**browser hijackers**](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

Browser Hijacker works exactly as per its name. It hijacks your browser and changes its settings to promote fake search engines and affiliated webpages. Usually, the fake search engines it supports are not capable of generating their own search results. So the search queries typed on them are redirected to the legit search engines such as Bing.com or Google.com.

After entering your browser, the browser hijacker or the browser virus changes the browser’s default homepage, search engine, and new tab redirection to the page it is promoting. It will keep altering your web browser’s settings until it is [completely removed](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) from it.

## How did Bing.com install on my computer?

The browser virus that aligns bing.com as the search engine on Chrome get an entry on your system through the following ways:

* When you accidentally or unknowingly install malicious applications.
* When you install a bundled software and browser hijacker comes with it.
* While browsing the internet, you click on a suspicious link that silently installs a browser virus.
* Users get attracted to the eye-catching [pop-ups](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) and banners and click on them without knowing their real intention.

## How do I remove Bing from Chrome?
