## What is Java Ransomware?

Java Ransomware is a malicious application that takes control of your computer and encrypts your files, requiring payment to decode and regain access to them. It typically spreads through malicious email attachments, software vulnerabilities, or by exploiting weak passwords. This kind of Ransomware uses Java programming language to execute its attacks. Paying the ransom is not recommended as it can encourage further illegal activities. Different types and forms of Java Ransomware are used to infect your devices, leaving you at the mercy of fraudulent attackers. They include; 

* Scareware
* Screen Lockers
* Encrypting ransomware
* Doxware
* Master boot record ransomware.
* Mobile Ransomware.

## How Does a Device Get Infected with Java Ransomware?

Java Ransomware infects a device through malicious attachments found in links, emails, and infected, suspicious software apps. It could infect a computer through infected removable storage devices and malicious websites. Most infections can also occur from using Remote Desktop Protocol and other strategies that do not necessarily need any form of user interaction. Also, another means a Java ransomware can exploit security holes to infect a system is by spreading it through chat messages, external Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, or browser plugins.

### Threat Analysis
