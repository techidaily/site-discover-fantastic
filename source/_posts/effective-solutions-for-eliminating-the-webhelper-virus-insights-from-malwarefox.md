## How did I get Infected?

The simplest notifications in your system can lead to the entry of frustrating viruses. These notifications or ads can gain direct access to your system. Even with just a click, they can invade the whole system resulting in the compromise of your privacy.

The web helper virus reaches the system through two components which are listed below:

1. **Webhelper.dll**: This webhelper is responsible for various pop-ups and ads that are being displayed on the system screen that can even automate the system. This program reinstalls webhelper when it is being uninstalled from the system.
1. **Utorrentie.exe**: The Utorrentie.exe runs in the background displaying annoying ads and slowing down the system process. It is a component of BitTorrent and displays ads for UTorrent clients.
