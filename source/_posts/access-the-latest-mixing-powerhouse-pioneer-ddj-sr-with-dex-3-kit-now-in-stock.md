After we created a custom _‘zero-configure’_ [map for the Pioneer DDJ-SR](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) a few weeks ago (_which is now included with the DEX 3 installer_), we all agreed the DDJ-SR is one of our favorite DJ controllers we’ve used with DEX 3 – and it’s just the right size to be highly portable for mobile gigs. It’s a smaller-footprint version of the popular Pioneer DDJ-SX version, designed for 2 deck control but with the same excellent performance pads, large Jog wheels for precise scratching and Pioneer DJ quality built-in mixer.

The DDJ-SR is a great fit for DJs that truly perform with DEX 3: scratching, triggering hot cues, looping, etc. Even if you don’t use those features, it’s a quality design that should hold up to any gig in any environment no matter how demanding. It looks fantastic, which doesn’t hurt.

_Here’s some of the key features included with the DDJ-SR:_
