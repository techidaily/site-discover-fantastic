## Can Phone Get Infected With Viruses?

One of the first questions people have when they find out that their phone may be infected is, “can my phone get a virus?” The short answer to this question is yes.

In fact, most experts believe that smartphones are even more vulnerable to malware than computers. A major reason for this is that many people don’t take the same precautions when using their phones that they do when using a computer. For example, many people will download apps from sources other than the official Google Play Store and Apple App Store, which can increase the risk of getting infected with malware.

## How do Phones Get Viruses?

There are a number of ways that your phone can become infected with a virus. Here are the most common ones:

* **Unsecured apps**: Many people download various apps on their phones without thinking about the security implications. These [apps may contain malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) that can infect your phone, giving hackers access to your personal information and data.
* **Phishing links or emails**. You may receive a link in an email or text message that seems to be from a trusted source. However, if you follow the link, it may actually take you to a website that installs malware on your phone.
* **Downloading files from unknown sources**: If you’re someone who likes to download files from torrents or other websites, then there’s a good chance that your device has been infected with a virus at some point.
* **Malicious Websites**: Hackers can also install malware on your phone by creating a fake website that looks like a legitimate site.

## Signs That Your Phone Has a Virus

If you suspect that your phone may have been infected with a virus, here are some signs to watch out for.

* **Sluggishness**: Your phone’s performance may slow down considerably when it has a virus installed on it. This may be due to the fact that the virus is hogging resources in order to complete its tasks.
* **New Apps**: Your phone may start downloading new apps, even though you did not install them yourself. These could be malicious apps that are designed to steal sensitive data from your device.
* **Popups and Advertisements**: You may notice that your phone’s web browser displays a lot of pop-up ads or banner ads. This is another sign that you may have an adware virus installed on your device.
* **Battery Drain**: A virus on your phone can also consume a lot of power, which will result in faster battery drainage. If you’re experiencing this symptom, then you may want to consider scanning your phone for viruses.
* **Poor Performance**: You may notice that your phone starts to freeze or crash more often than normal. This is yet another sign that could indicate the presence of a virus on your device.
* **Unusual Data Usage**: If you notice that your data usage has spiked for no apparent reason, then this could be a sign that your phone may have been infected with a virus.
* **Strange Text Messages**: If you receive text messages from numbers that you don’t recognize, then this could indicate the presence of a virus.
* **Regular Overheating**: Overheating is expected when you use your Android phone extensively, like while playing games or watching videos. When an application is continuously operating in the background, then along with battery drainage, it will also cause overheating. If you observe that your phone is overheating even though you aren’t using it, it may be because of a virus.
