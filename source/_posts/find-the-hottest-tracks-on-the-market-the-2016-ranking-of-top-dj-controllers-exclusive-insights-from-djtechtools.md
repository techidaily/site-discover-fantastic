[![Top Selling DJ controllers of 2016](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/djcontrollerstopselling-coverimage.jpg?resize=706%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/djcontrollerstopselling-coverimage.jpg?fit=706%2C360&ssl=1 "Top Selling DJ controllers of 2016")

Citing an industry sales report, [DJTechTools.com](http://www.djtechtools.com) recently posted [the top 10 selling DJ controllers in 2016](http://djtechtools.com/2017/02/07/what-were-the-top-10-selling-dj-controllers-in-2016/).

We always get a kick out of comparing our own [DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) user requests with industry reports to see just how close they mirror each other. Looking at the top 10 selling [DJ controllers](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) from [DJTechTools.com](http://www.djtechtools.com) there weren’t any real mind-blowing surprises. Our [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and [DEX 3 RE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) DJ mixing software products support 6 out of 10 controllers in the list, including the top 3 sellers from last year.

[Numark](https://www.numark.com/) and [Pioneer DJ](https://www.pioneerdj.com) were clearly the top box movers with all but one listed controller not produced by either DJ equipment powerhouse. Pioneer DJ still holds the DJ controller crown ‘winning’ gold, silver and bronze positions atop the chart. No surprise there when checking our own data; the DDJ-SX2 (professional-level DJ controller) and DDJ-SB2 (entry-level DJ controller) were also highly popular among [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and [DEX 3 RE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) DJs.

All 6 of the supported best-selling [DJ controllers](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) of 2016 below are ‘_zero-configure_‘ with our [DJ mixing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/).
